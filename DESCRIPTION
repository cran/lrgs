Description: Implements a Gibbs sampler to do linear regression with multiple covariates, multiple responses, Gaussian measurement errors on covariates and responses, Gaussian intrinsic scatter, and a covariate prior distribution which is given by either a Gaussian mixture of specified size or a Dirichlet process with a Gaussian base distribution. Described further in Mantz (2016) <DOI:10.1093/mnras/stv3008>.
